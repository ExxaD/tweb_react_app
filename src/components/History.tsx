                Welcome to Pizza Palace, a family-owned pizza store that has been serving delicious pizza to our community for over 50 years. Our story began in 1970 when our founder, Tony, had a dream of opening a pizza store that would serve the best pizza in town.

                With hard work and determination, Tony opened the doors to Pizza Palace in a small storefront on Main Street. At first, it was just Tony and his wife making the pizzas and serving customers. But as word of mouth spread about their delicious pies, the demand grew, and they hired a few more staff members to help.

                As the years went on, Pizza Palace continued to expand. We moved to a larger location, added more items to our menu, and hired more employees. Through it all, we have never compromised on our commitment to quality ingredients and excellent customer service.

Whether it's a family dinner, a game night with friends, or a late-night snack, we are always here to serve up a hot and fresh pizza that will satisfy any craving. Thank you for choosing Pizza Palace, and we look forward to serving you for many more years to come!
